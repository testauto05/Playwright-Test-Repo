<!-- In JavaScript, event handling typically involves the following steps:

1. Selecting the Element: Identify the HTML element you want to add an event to. This can be done using 
various methods like getElementById, querySelector, or by referencing elements directly.

2. Attaching an Event Listener: Use the addEventListener method to attach an event listener to the selected
element.
This method takes the event type (such as 'click', 'mouseover', 'keydown', etc.) and a function that will
be executed when the event occurs.

3. Defining the Event Handler Function: This function specifies the actions to be taken when the event occurs.
It can access information about the event through its parameters, such as the event object, target element, 
mouse coordinates, etc.

Here's an example using DOM event handling. In this example we want to change the 
background color of a box when we click the right mouse button. -->
