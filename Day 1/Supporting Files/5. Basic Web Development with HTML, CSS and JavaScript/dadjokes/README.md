## App Architecture

This app consists of:

- HTML
- Bootstrap CSS

## App Deployment

This app requires a MySQL database. You will need to host the database somewhere. In the repo there are files with SQL code for creating the database, table, and for inserting the jokes. The folder path is _dadjokes/setup/createdbandinsertjokes/_
